It's a service that sets up scaling distributed training so data scientists and machine learning engineers do not have to worry about technical infrastructure. Usually, it automatically selects the [container environment](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/runtime-version-list), but we're going to take advantage of a feature to specify our own environment with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container). Not only will this allow us to install our game environment to be deployed to the cloud, but it will also significantly speed up hyperparameter tuning time as each worker can skip the library installation steps.\n",

First, we copy from a [Google Deep Learning Container](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/deep-learning-containers/docs/choosing-container) which already has Google Cloud Libraries installed. Then, we install our other desired modules and libraries. `ffmpeg`, `xvfb`, and `python-opengl` are needed in order to get video output from the server. Machines on the cloud don't typically have a display (why would they need one?), so we'll make a virtual display of our own.\n",

In order to set up our virtual display, we can use the [xvfb-run](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/xvfb-run.1.html) command. Unfortunately, Docker strips quotes from specified commands in ENTRYPOINT, so we'll make a super simple shell script, <a href=\"train_model.sh\">train_model.sh</a>, to specify our virtual display parameters. The `\"@\"` parameter is used to pass the flags called against the container to our python module, `trainer.trainer`.\n",
